# GT Sport Ratings

Stack:

- Preact (current bundle = 38kb vs React version of 140kb)
- Typescript
- Rollup for bundling
- tailwindcss through postcss + purgecss
- zustand for state management (hooks only!)
- Netlify functions (for server side post request to gran-turismo API)
- Service workers
- Mobile first. Progressive Web App makes it feel like a native app crossplatform + no update-by-user required
